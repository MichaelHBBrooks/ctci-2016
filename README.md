# My Solutions

I occasionally like to do some coding tests just to keep my mind sharp. These are some of my answers.

## How to Run

### Requirements

-   Node version 16.18.0 or higher must be installed.
-   NPM version 8.19.0 or higher must be installed.

### Commands

`npm ci` - Installs the packages used to run and test the Node application.

`npm run dev` - Runs the program. Nothing should happen unless some tests were installed at the root level index file.

`npm run test` - Performs a series of Mocha tests to verify the functions perform as expected.
